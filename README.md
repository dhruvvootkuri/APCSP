# APCSP
Hello Mr. Brown!  This is my github repository, which includes some of my best scripts.  

I understand that you may not have enough time to check every single script in every branch, but please take a look at my scripts in Advanced-C.  
These scripts use very advanced computer science concepts, which is why they best represent my skill in Computer Science speicfically, not just programming in general.

There, you will find:
  dictionary.c: A script that creates a hash table to store a 143,091-word dictionary and spell-check any given document
  recover.c: A script that takes a memory card as input, and outputs jpeg's from that card (however, the memory card needs to be structured such that the jpeg files are in 512-byte blocks as well as non-jpeg's, except for the last bit)
  helpers.c: A script used to filter an image, either with a blurred,sepia,grayscale,or reflected effect.
  
Of course, I script mainly in Python, which is why that branch is important for you to take a look at as well (although, they aren't necessarily a representation of computer sceince specifically).

There, you will find:
  TKFUNTIME-copy.py: A script that uses Tkinter and SQLite3, where the user has to find a number from 1-100 on a 10x10 grid of buttons.  
  As they click, they're score is affected.  They are also allowed to use hints, but that costs them more points.  The score is sent to an SQLite3 databse at the very end.
  TreasureHunt.py: A script that uses OpenCV.  
  It is sort of like a scavenger hunt, where you need to find pieces around the house, and hold it up to the camera for the computer to "verify" it.
